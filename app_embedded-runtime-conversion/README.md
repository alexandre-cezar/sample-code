# app_embedded_conversion_tool
A script that converts container policies to app embedded policies

Simply export a container runtime policy that you want to convert into an app-embedded policy and modify the code to look for your specific json file. 
Put the file in the same folder where the script is hosted. The script will generate an app-embedded runtime policy as output.
